# OpenAI GPT3 Generator

### About this project
This project was built as a frontend engineering challenge for the 2022 Shopify internship. The challenge was to create an application that uses OpenAI's API to make requests to their GPT3 AI engines with. With the functionality as the only requirement, the rest of the project - design, options, libraries, etc. - was open to demonstrate personal style, creativeness, and approach.

This project was built with Next.js as the foundation, and was styled with Chakra UI and Styled Components.

### Open AI and GPT-3
The AI response generator was built using OpenAI's GPT-3 and its varius AI engines, with each request being sent via [OpenAI's Node.js library](https://beta.openai.com/docs/libraries/node-js-library).
